If omitted or negative, the entire content of the file will be read.\n\nreadlines()\n\nReads the entire file and returns a list of strings, each representing one line of the file.\nSyntax: file.readlines(hint=-1)\nThe hint parameter is optional and can be used to control the number of lines read.

To handle errors that occur during file operations.\n\nExplanation: The try...except block is used to catch and handle exceptions, like FileNotFoundError, that might occur during file operations.\n\nAnswer: C. Random-Access Memory (RAM)\n\nExplanation: RAM is a type of primary memory, not secondary (persistent) memory. Flash Memory, HDD, and SSD are examples of secondary memory.\n\nAnswer: A. No file handle\n\nExplanation: The correct syntax should be with open(file,'w') as f: f.write(\"Hello\"). The file handle (f) is missing in the given code.\n\nAnswer: B. When the file is in a different directory than the current one.\n\nExplanation: Absolute paths are needed when accessing files that are not in the current working directory."

To improve the performance of file reading/writing.\n\nWhich of the following is not an example of secondary (persistent) memory?\n\nA. Flash Memory\nB. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)\nC. Random-Access Memory (RAM)\nD. Solid State Disk (SSD)\n\nWhat is wrong with the following code: with open(file,'w'): file.write(\"Hello\")?\n\nA. No file handle\nB. Cannot write - file opened for reading\nC. File a.txt does not exist\nD. Nothing is wrong!\n\nWhen is an absolute path required in file handling in Python?\n\nA. When the file is in the current working directory.\nB. When the file is in a different directory than the current one.\nC. Only when the file is on a different physical drive.\nD. Absolute paths are never required in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: A. Opens the file in write mode and creates a file handle named f.\n\nExplanation: The with open() statement opens a file in the specified mode (‘w’ for write in this case) and assigns a handle (f) for file operations.\n\nAnswer: C. To handle errors that occur during file operations.\n\nExplanation: The try...except block is used to catch and handle exceptions, like FileNotFoundError, that might occur during file operations.\n\nAnswer: C. Random-Access Memory (RAM)\n\nExplanation: RAM is a type of primary memory, not secondary (persistent) memory. Flash Memory, HDD, and SSD are examples of secondary memory.\n\nAnswer: A. No file handle\n\nExplanation: The correct syntax should be with open(file,'w') as f: f.write(\"Hello\"). The file handle (f) is missing in the given code.\n\nAnswer: B. When the file is in a different directory than the current one.\n\nExplanation: Absolute paths are needed when accessing files that are not in the current working directory."

    "text": "Bert’s contempt for Lists knows no bounds!\n\n\n\n\nBert made a summary of the syntax for each of the Python list functions in the study guide:\n\nappend()\n\nAdds an element to the end of the list.\nSyntax: list.append(element)\n\nindex()\n\nReturns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.\nSyntax: list.index(element, start, end)\nThe start and end parameters are optional and specify the search range.\n\ninsert()\n\nInserts an element at the specified position.\nSyntax: list.insert(index, element)\n\npop()\n\nRemoves and returns the element at the specified position.\nSyntax: list.pop(index)\nIf the index is not specified, pop() removes and returns the last element.\n\nremove()\n\nRemoves the first occurrence of the specified element.\nSyntax: list.remove(element)\n\nreverse()\n\nReverses the elements of the list in place.\nSyntax: list.reverse()\n\ncount()\n\nReturns the number of times the specified element appears in the list.\nSyntax: list.count(element)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutable: Lists in Python can be changed after they are created.

[2,3]\n\n\nExplanation: The slice x[2:4] extracts elements from index 2 up to but not including index 4, resulting in [2, 3].\n\n\nAnswer: A. myList.append(newElement)\n\n\nExplanation: append() is the correct method to add an element to the end of a list. The other options are either incorrect methods or overly complicated.\n\n\nAnswer: A. list3 = list1 + list2\n\n\nExplanation: The + operator concatenates two lists. append() and extend() methods modify the list in place and do not return a new list.\n\n\nAnswer: A.

[4, 2, 5, 6]\nExplanation: The code changes the element at index 2 (third element) from 8 to 5.\nAnswer: B. [\"apple\", \"cherry\"]\nExplanation: The remove() method removes the first occurrence of the element “banana” from the list.\nAnswer: C. 8\nExplanation: The append() method adds one element, and extend() adds three more elements, making the total length 8.\nAnswer: B. [20, 30, 40]\nExplanation: The slice [1:4] includes elements from index 1 to 3 (20, 30, 40).\nAnswer: B. insert()\nExplanation: The insert() method is used to add an element at a specified index. append() adds to the end, extend() adds multiple elements, and add() is not a list method. ```\n\nThis format should correctly render in Quarto, displaying both the questions and their answers in a structured and readable format."

If omitted or negative, the entire content of the file will be read.\n\nreadlines()\n\nReads the entire file and returns a list of strings, each representing one line of the file.\nSyntax: file.readlines(hint=-1)\nThe hint parameter is optional and can be used to control the number of lines read. If the total number of characters read is approximately hint, reading stops.\n\nwrite()\n\nWrites a specified string to the file.\nSyntax: file.write(string)\nThis function writes the string to the file, returning the number of characters written.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence Layer: Files allow for data storage beyond the runtime of a program.\nFile Operations: Mainly include reading from and writing to files.\nFile Handle: A variable created by opening a file, used to perform operations on the file.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Methods:\n\nRead All at Once: Using handle.read() inside a with open(filename, 'r') as handle block.\nRead Line by Line: Looping over handle.readlines() to process each line individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite Mode ('w'): Overwrites the file or creates a new one if it doesn’t exist.\nAppend Mode ('a'): Adds content to the end of the file without overwriting existing content.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Path: Specifies a file location relative to the current directory.\nAbsolute Path: Specifies the exact file location on the filesystem from the root directory.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry-Except Block: Essential for handling I/O operations to manage exceptions like FileNotFoundError.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples: Programs that save text messages, read and calculate average grades, calorie lookups in a data file, and a spell checker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does with open(file,'w') as f do in a Python script?\n\nA.
